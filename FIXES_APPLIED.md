## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Icon Import Errors
**Problem**: All components were importing from `@heroicons/react` which is not installed.

**Solution**: Updated all icon imports to use `lucide-react` (the project's icon library):
- `ArrowLeftIcon` â†’ `ArrowLeft`
- `ClockIcon` â†’ `Clock`
- `ArrowPathIcon` â†’ `RotateCw`
- `CheckCircleIcon` â†’ `CheckCircle`
- `XCircleIcon` â†’ `XCircle`
- `UserCircleIcon` â†’ `UserCircle`
- `CameraIcon` â†’ `Camera`
- `CalendarIcon` â†’ `Calendar`
- `CurrencyRupeeIcon` â†’ `IndianRupee`
- `XMarkIcon` â†’ `X`
- `FunnelIcon` â†’ `Filter`

**Files Updated**:
- PaymentRequestsPage.jsx
- PendingRequestsTab.jsx
- ResubmissionsTab.jsx
- PaymentRequestCard.jsx
- VerifyPaymentModal.jsx
- RejectPaymentModal.jsx
- RequestFilters.jsx

---

### 2. âœ… Toast Library Mismatch
**Problem**: Components were importing from `react-toastify` which is not installed.

**Solution**: Updated all toast imports to use `react-hot-toast` (the project's toast library):
- Changed `import { toast } from 'react-toastify'` to `import { toast } from 'react-hot-toast'`

**Files Updated**:
- PaymentRequestsPage.jsx
- PendingRequestsTab.jsx
- ResubmissionsTab.jsx
- VerifyPaymentModal.jsx
- RejectPaymentModal.jsx

---

### 3. âœ… Statistics Data Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend was looking for `data.statistics.overall.*` but backend returns `data.overall.*` directly.

**Solution**: Updated TreasurerDashboardNew.jsx to use correct data structure:
```javascript
// Before
const data = await getStatistics();
setStatistics(data.statistics);
// Using: statistics?.overall?.pendingResubmissions

// After
const data = await getStatistics();
setStatistics(data.overall);
// Using: statistics?.pendingResubmissions
```

**Files Updated**:
- TreasurerDashboardNew.jsx

---

### 4. âœ… Statistics Card Data Properties
**Problem**: StatCards were referencing non-existent properties like `currentMonth.collected`.

**Solution**: Updated StatCards to use actual API response properties:
- Removed `currentMonth` card (not in API response)
- Changed to `totalCollection` (which exists in API response)
- Fixed `failedPayments` reference (removed `.overall` nesting)
- Fixed `pendingResubmissions` reference (removed `.overall` nesting)

**Changes**:
```javascript
// Before
statistics?.overall?.totalFailedPayments
statistics?.overall?.pendingResubmissions
statistics?.currentMonth?.collected

// After
statistics?.failedPayments
statistics?.pendingResubmissions
statistics?.totalCollection
```

---

### 5. âœ… Navigation Route Fix
**Problem**: Back button was navigating to `/treasurer/dashboard` which doesn't exist.

**Solution**: Updated to correct route `/treasurer-dashboard`

**Files Updated**:
- PaymentRequestsPage.jsx

---

3. You should see:
   - **Payment Requests button** in the top right of dashboard header
   - Badge with count if there are pending resubmissions
   - All statistics cards displaying correctly

### 3. Test Payment Requests Page:
1. Click "Payment Requests" button
2. Should navigate to `/treasurer/payment-requests`
3. Two tabs: "Pending Requests" and "Resubmissions"
4. Use filters to narrow down requests
5. Click on payment proof images to enlarge
6. Test Verify and Reject actions

## Known Notes

### About the `jsx` Warning:
The warning "Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `jsx`" is likely from:
- A Vite/React plugin configuration
- An ESLint comment somewhere
- Or a React DevTools extension

This is typically a **non-critical warning** and doesn't affect functionality. It's usually from development tools, not the application code itself.

**If the warning persists**, check:
1. Browser console for the exact source
2. Vite HMR overlay settings
3. React DevTools extension

## API Response Structure

### GET /api/treasurer/statistics

    "totalMembers": 50,
    "totalCollection": 25000,
    "pendingPayments": 5,
    "failedPayments": 3,
    "pendingResubmissions": 2,
    "walletBalance": 10000
  }
}
```

### GET /api/treasurer/payment-requests

        "usn": "1RV21CS001",

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **Clear browser cache** if you see any stale data
2. âœ… **Test all functionality** - verify, reject, filters
3. âœ… **Check backend logs** for any API errors
4. âœ… **Monitor browser console** for any remaining warnings
5. âœ… **Add test payment data** if database is empty
