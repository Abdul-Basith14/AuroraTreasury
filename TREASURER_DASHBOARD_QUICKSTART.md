# Treasurer Dashboard - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Quick Setup & Testing

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- MongoDB running
- Backend and frontend dependencies installed

### Step 1: Start the Servers

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```
Server should start on http://localhost:5000

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```
Frontend should start on http://localhost:5173

### Step 2: Create Test Data

You need:
1. **Treasurer Account** - User with role 'treasurer'
2. **Member Accounts** - Users with role 'member'
3. **Group Fund Payments** - Payment records for testing

### Option A: Use Existing Data
If you already have users and payments in your database, skip to Step 3.

### Option B: Create Test Data Manually

**Create a Treasurer Account:**
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/signup
2. Fill in the form with treasurer details
3. **Important:** In MongoDB, manually change the user's role to 'treasurer'
   ```javascript
   // In MongoDB Compass or Shell
   db.users.updateOne(
     { email: "treasurer@example.com" },
     { $set: { role: "treasurer" } }
   )
   ```

**Create Member Accounts:**
1. Sign up multiple members through the signup page
2. They will have role 'member' by default

**Create Payment Records:**
Use the Member Dashboard or create directly in MongoDB with sample data.

### Step 3: Login as Treasurer

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Failed to load members"
**Cause:** Backend not running or wrong API URL  
**Fix:** 
- Check backend is running on port 5000
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` in `client/.env`
- Check browser console for actual error

### Issue 2: Statistics show all zeros
**Cause:** No payment data in database  
**Fix:** Create payment records for members

**Cause:** Typing too fast (within debounce time)  
**Fix:** Wait 500ms after typing, results will appear

### Issue 4: Members not grouped correctly
**Cause:** Year field format mismatch  
**Fix:** Ensure year is stored as "1st", "2nd", "3rd", or "4th" (not "first", "1", etc.)

### Issue 5: Export button not working
**Cause:** Browser blocking downloads  
**Fix:** Check browser settings, allow downloads from localhost

### Issue 6: Modal not closing
**Cause:** JavaScript error in modal  
**Fix:** Check browser console, refresh page
