# Testing Checklist - Payment Status & Manual Update

## ✅ Features to Test

### 1. **Manual Payment Update Button**

### 2. **Payment Status Updates**

**Current Status Logic:**
- **"Pending"** = Payment submitted OR no payment but deadline hasn't passed (before 5th)
- **"Paid"** = Payment verified by treasurer
- **"Failed"** = No payment submitted and deadline passed (after 5th of month)

**To test:**
1. Go to monthly member list
2. Check status badges:
   - 🟢 Green = Paid
   - 🟡 Yellow = Pending
   - 🔴 Red = Failed

---

### 3. **Monthly Wallet (Total Collected)**

**Location:** Top of monthly member list page

**Shows:**
- Total Members
- Paid Count
- Pending Count
- Failed Count
- **Total Collected** (monthly wallet) ← THIS IS YOUR MONTHLY WALLET!

**To verify it updates:**
1. Note the current "Total Collected" amount
2. Mark a pending payment as paid
3. The page will refresh automatically
4. ✅ "Total Collected" should increase by the payment amount
5. ✅ "Paid Count" should increase by 1
6. ✅ "Pending Count" should decrease by 1

---

### 4. **Overall Wallet Balance**

**Location:** Treasurer Dashboard → Wallet Balance card

**To verify it updates:**
1. Note current wallet balance on dashboard
2. Mark a payment as paid (or verify a payment request)
3. Go back to dashboard (click "Dashboard" or "Back" button)
4. ✅ Wallet balance should be updated with the new amount

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Mark Paid" button not showing

**Possible reasons:**
1. Member status is not "Pending" (check status column)
2. No payment record exists for that member in that month (paymentId is null)
3. Member already paid

**Solution:**
- Only members with **yellow "Pending"** badge will have the button
- If member has no payment record, submit one as a member first

---

### Issue: Status not updating after marking as paid

**Check:**
1. Did you see a success toast notification?
2. Did the page refresh automatically?
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Check server logs for errors

**Manual refresh:**
- Click on a different month, then click back
- Or refresh the page (F5)

---

### Issue: Monthly wallet not updating

**Verify:**
1. Check if status actually changed to "Paid" (green badge)
2. Look at the summary cards at the top:
   - "Paid" count should increase
   - "Total Collected" should increase
3. Amount should match the payment amount

**If not updating:**
- Refresh the page manually
- Check if multiple payments are being counted
- Verify backend logs show wallet update

---

### Issue: Overall wallet not updating

**Steps:**
1. Make sure you mark payment as paid
2. See success message
3. Navigate BACK to dashboard (don't just wait on same page)
4. Wallet should show updated balance

**Note:** Dashboard auto-refreshes when you:
- Switch browser tabs and come back
- Navigate away and come back
- Can also manually refresh (F5)
