## Fixes Implemented

### Issue #1: Wallet Not Updating for Resubmitted Payments

**Problem:** The `verifyResubmission` function was missing the wallet update logic that exists in `verifyPayment`.

**Fix:** Added wallet update to `verifyResubmission` function in `server/controllers/treasurerController.js`

**Changes:**
- Added wallet update after verifying resubmitted payments (lines 724-730)
- Now properly adds money to wallet when resubmission is verified
- Consistent with the regular payment verification flow

```javascript
// Update wallet balance
const wallet = await Wallet.getWallet();
await wallet.addMoney(
  payment.amount,
  `Resubmitted payment from ${user.name} (${user.usn}) for ${payment.month} ${payment.year}`,
  req.user._id
);
```

### Issue #2: API Response Consistency

**Problem:** The `manualPaymentUpdate` API function was returning `response.data` instead of `response`, causing inconsistency with other API functions.

**Fix:** Updated API response handling in `client/src/utils/treasurerAPI.js`

**Changes:**
- Changed `return response.data` to `return response` (line 299)
- Updated error handling in `ManualPaymentUpdateModal.jsx` to properly access response data
- Ensures consistent API response structure across all endpoints

---

### Issue #3: Manual Payment Option Not Available

**Problem:** 
- Manual update button only showed for members with existing payment records
- No way to manually mark members as paid if they hadn't submitted payment online
- Treasurers couldn't record cash payments for members without pending submissions

**Fix:** Created comprehensive manual payment system with two approaches:

#### A. New Endpoint: Create Manual Payment

**Created:** `POST /api/treasurer/create-manual-payment`

**Purpose:** Allows treasurers to create and mark payments as paid in one step for members who paid cash/offline

**Features:**
- Creates new payment record with status "Paid"
- Updates user's total paid amount
- Updates wallet balance
- Records payment method (Cash, Bank Transfer, Other)
- Adds optional notes for record-keeping
- Full status history tracking

**Backend Changes:**
- Added `createManualPayment` controller function (lines 806-895 in treasurerController.js)
- Added route in `server/routes/treasurer.js`
- Validates user exists and prevents duplicate payments for same month/year

#### B. Enhanced Manual Update Modal

**Frontend Changes:**
- Imported `createManualPayment` API function
- Updated `ManualPaymentUpdateModal` to handle both:
  - Updating existing pending payments
  - Creating new payment records for members without submissions
- Automatically determines which operation to perform based on presence of payment._id

#### C. Enhanced Member List by Month

**Changes to `client/src/components/treasurer/MembersListByMonth.jsx`:**

1. **Fetches Club Settings** (lines 38-51)
   - Retrieves default monthly amounts based on member year
   - Uses club settings to determine correct payment amount

2. **Shows Manual Update Button for ALL Pending Members** (lines 378-391)
   - Previously: Only showed for members with existing payment records
   - Now: Shows for ALL members with "Pending" status
   - Allows marking any pending member as paid, even without submission

3. **Smart Amount Detection** (lines 145-169)
   - Uses existing payment amount if available
   - Falls back to year-based default from club settings
   - Ensures correct amount is charged based on member's year

4. **Visual Feedback** (lines 387-388)
   - Shows checkmark for paid members
   - Clear visual distinction between different payment statuses
