## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Modal doesn't open
**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Issue: Image won't upload
**Causes**:
1. File too large (> 5MB)
2. Wrong format (not jpg/png/webp)
3. Cloudinary not configured
4. Network issue

### Issue: Payment shows wrong amount
**Solution**: Check user's year field in database matches ClubSettings

### Issue: Download button doesn't work
**Solution**: Verify payment status is "Paid" and paymentProof URL exists
