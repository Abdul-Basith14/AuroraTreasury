## Usage

**Backend:**
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Use treasurer credentials
   - You'll be redirected to `/treasurer-dashboard`

2. **View Dashboard:**
   - See statistics cards at the top
   - View all members in the grid below

3. **Filter Members:**
   - Click year tabs to filter by academic year
   - Click status chips to filter by payment status
   - Use search bar to find specific members

4. **View Member Details:**
   - Click "View Details" on any member card

6. **Export Data:**

## Authentication & Authorization

All treasurer routes are protected by two middleware:
1. **auth middleware** (`protect`): Verifies JWT token
2. **treasurerAuth middleware**: Ensures user has treasurer role

```javascript
router.use(protect);
router.use(treasurerAuth);
```

## Error Handling

### Backend
- All controllers use try-catch blocks
- Returns standardized error responses
- Logs errors to console

### Frontend
- Uses react-hot-toast for user notifications
- Loading states for async operations
- Empty states for no data
- Error boundaries recommended

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Debounced Search**: 500ms delay to reduce API calls
2. **Parallel Data Fetching**: Statistics and members fetched independently
3. **Efficient Filtering**: Status filter applied after stats calculation
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints:
- **Mobile** (<768px): Single column layout
- **Tablet** (768px-1024px): 2 columns for cards
- **Desktop** (>1024px): 3 columns for cards, full layout

### Mobile Features:
- Collapsible filters
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Optimized spacing
- Horizontal scroll for tabs

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
1. **Payment Verification**: Allow treasurers to verify/reject payments
2. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple members for actions
3. **Email Notifications**: Send reminders to members
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Charts and graphs for insights
5. **Report Generation**: PDF reports for accounting
6. **Payment History Export**: Individual member payment exports
7. **Resubmission Management**: Review and approve resubmissions
8. **Settings Management**: Configure payment amounts and deadlines

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Members not loading:**
- Check API endpoint is correct in `.env`
- Verify treasurer is logged in
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify MongoDB connection

**2. Search not working:**
- Wait 500ms after typing (debounce)
- Check network tab for API calls
- Verify search query format

**3. Statistics showing zero:**
- Ensure members and payments exist in database
- Check current month format in backend
- Verify aggregate queries

**4. Export not working:**
- Check browser allows downloads
- Verify CSV data format
- Check console for errors

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing:
- [ ] GET /api/treasurer/members - all members
- [ ] GET /api/treasurer/members?year=1st - filtered by year
- [ ] GET /api/treasurer/members?status=failed - filtered by status
- [ ] GET /api/treasurer/members?search=john - search query
- [ ] GET /api/treasurer/member/:userId/payments - member payments
- [ ] GET /api/treasurer/statistics - dashboard stats
- [ ] GET /api/treasurer/failed-payments-summary - failed payments
- [ ] Authorization works (treasurer only)
- [ ] Non-treasurer gets 403 error

### Frontend Testing:
- [ ] Dashboard loads statistics
- [ ] Members grid displays correctly
- [ ] Year filter tabs work
- [ ] Status filter chips work
- [ ] Search bar filters members
- [ ] Member cards show correct data
- [ ] Click member card opens modal
- [ ] Member details modal shows payments
- [ ] Failed payments button works
- [ ] Failed payments modal displays summary
- [ ] Export downloads CSV
- [ ] Reset filters button works
- [ ] Loading states display
- [ ] Empty states display
- [ ] Error messages show
- [ ] Responsive on mobile
- [ ] Logout button works

## API Response Times

Expected response times:
- **Get Members**: < 500ms (50-100 members)
- **Get Statistics**: < 300ms
- **Get Member Payments**: < 200ms
- **Get Failed Payments Summary**: < 300ms

## Security Considerations

1. **JWT Authentication**: All routes require valid token
2. **Role-Based Access**: Only treasurers can access
3. **Input Validation**: Search queries sanitized
4. **MongoDB Injection Prevention**: Mongoose handles escaping
5. **CORS Configuration**: Restricted to frontend URL

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Required:

**Backend (.env):**
```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**Frontend (.env):**
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### Production Considerations:
1. Set appropriate CORS origins
2. Use production MongoDB cluster
3. Enable rate limiting
4. Add request logging
5. Monitor API performance
6. Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
