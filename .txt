#git checkout backup-before-feature
# Perfect! If your experiment (new feature) works successfully, you want to merge it back into your main stable branch so it becomes part of your official project. Here‚Äôs how to do it safely:

# üß≠ Steps After Successful Experiment
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure everything is committed in your feature branch
# git add .
# git commit -m "Added new feature successfully"

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Switch to main branch (or your stable branch)
# git checkout main

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Merge your feature branch into main
# git merge feature-new-ui


# This incorporates all your changes from the feature branch.

# If Git says ‚ÄúAlready up to date‚Äù ‚Üí you might have committed directly to main; otherwise it merges normally.

# Resolve any conflicts if they appear.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Push the updated main branch to GitHub
# git push origin main

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Delete the feature branch

# Once merged, you can clean up locally:

# git branch -d feature-new-ui


# And on GitHub:

# git push origin --delete feature-new-ui
